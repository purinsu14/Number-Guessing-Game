**Number Guessing Game**
This is a simple number guessing game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100. You can choose from three difficulty levels, each with a different number of chances. The game keeps track of your high scores and total playtime.


**Features**
- Difficulty Levels: Choose between Easy (10 chances), Medium (5 chances), and Hard (3 chances).
- Player Profiles: The game saves player data, including high scores and total playtime, to a playerdata.json file.
- High Score Tracking: The game records your best performance for each difficulty level.
- Time Tracking: Your total playtime is accumulated and displayed.
